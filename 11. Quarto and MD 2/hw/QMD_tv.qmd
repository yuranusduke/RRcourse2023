# Short Description

*Breaking Bad* is an American crime drama television series created and
produced by Vince Gilligan. Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico,
the series follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid,
overqualified, and dispirited high-school chemistry teacher who is
struggling with a recent diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer. White
turns to a life of crime and partners with a former student, Jesse
Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to produce and distribute methamphetamine to
secure his family's financial future before he dies, while navigating
the dangers of the criminal underworld. The show aired on AMC from
January 20, 2008, to September 29, 2013, consisting of five seasons for
a total of 62 episodes, result is shown in below figure.

# Viewership

*Breaking Bad* premiered on the same night as both the NFC and AFC
Championships in the 2008 NFL playoffs, an intentional decision by AMC
hoping to capture the adult male viewership immediately following the
planned end of the NFC game. The game ran over its time slot, cutting
into *Breaking Bad*'s timeslot in most of America. As a result, the
pilot had only about 1.4 million viewers. Coupled with the ongoing
writers strike, the first season did not draw as large of a viewership
as they expected. However, with subsequent seasons, viewership
increased, avoiding the usual trend of downward viewership that most
serialized shows had. Ratings further increased by the fourth season as,
prior to airing, the previous seasons had been added to Netflix,
boosting interest in the show. *Breaking Bad* is considered the first
such show to have a renewed burst of interest due to the show being made
available on Netflix. The second half of the final season saw record
viewership, with the series finale reaching over 10.3 million viewers,
results are shown in below figure.
